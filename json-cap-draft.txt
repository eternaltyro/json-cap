0. INTRODUCTION

This document specifies the purpose, function, design and structure of a 
new proposed protocol standard used to transmit alert messages between 
systems using the popular JSON data interchange format RFC7519[1].  

The proposed protocol is called CAP-JSON. Its name is based on the
abbreviation of "Common Alerting Protocol" an OASIS XML[3] standard for 
exchanging alert messages between systems. This document specifies an
alternative approach based on JSON instead of XML.

Why authorities and syndicates ? Trust for authorities ? 

6.1. CAP-JSON Structure

CAP-JSON is a valid JSON document containing alert messages that indicate
useful information about emergencies or disasters.  A single complete JSON
object containinng all required keys and values for a single alert message
is called a "frame".  Each frame SHOULD provide information about one event
or incident.  A frame MUST NOT contain alert messages for more than one  
event.

The attributes of a single CAP-JSON frame are defined. 

6.1. Unique Identifier String

This attribute declares a unique, unambiguous string of characters that is 
used to distinguish one alert frame from other.  The format for the Unique 
identifier string MUST follow the format specified below.

THE unique identifier string MUST be made up of colon-separated attributes.  
The attributes in their intended sequential order are given below.

1.   A unique short CAP-JSON Identifier string.
2.   A universally unique Authority code for the publishing authority
3.   Alert Level color or threat code
4.   Country identifier based on either "ISO 3166-1 alpha-3" or 
     "ISO 3166-1 numeric" 
4.a. If the emergency is in multiple countries?
4.b. If the emergency is in a continent?
5.   State or Province short code
5.a. If the emergency is in the whole state, use single 0
5.b. If the emergency is in multiple states, use X
6.   PINCODE / POST Code
6.a. If Pincode is not known, then use X
7.   Category of emergency
8.   Date in ISO date-time format followed by hyphen followed by 3-digit
     decimal sequence number.

Should not be case sensitive

6.1.1. Authority

An Authority is an individual, group or organization that publishes alert
messages in CAP-JSON format for public consumption.  An authority MAY be a
government meteorological agency, an individual hobbyist or a university.
Authorities MAY choose to independantly publish their CAP-JSON feeds for 
public or restricted consumption. 

Authorities MUST assign to themselves a universally unique identifier code
to distinguish themselves from all other Authorities.  Authorites that 
register themselves to a Syndicate SHALL be assigned a unique identifier 
code by the Syndicate.  

6.1.2. Syndicate

A Syndicate is an individual, group or organization that aggregates 
CAP-JSON from multiple authorities.  A syndicate SHOULD aggregate CAP-JSON
feeds from multiple public authorities.  Syndicates MAY also allow multiple
authorities to subscribe themselves to it.  Syndicate MAY choose to publish
their CAP-JSON feeds for public or restricted consumption.
 
Syndicates MUST assign to themselves a universally unique "Identifier Code"
that distinguishes themselves from all other syndicates.  Syndicates MUST 
also assign to each authority subscribed to it, a universally unique 
"identifier code" that distinguishes authorities from one another.  The 
unique identifier code MUST be specified in each CAP feed. 

6.1.3. Universally unique Authority identifier

Each authority MUST be assigned a universally unique identifier code that 
is used to distinguish them from every other authority.  The identifier 
code SHALL be self assigned or SHALL be assigned by a Syndicate the 
authority registers to.

The identifier code for authorities MUST follow the format described below:

A three-character code describing the nature of the authority followed by a
hyphen followed by a six character unique hexadecimal number.  The three 
character codes are assigned as follows:

  IND - Individual / Hobbyist
  GOV - Government agency / meteorology department
  EXP - Research groups / experimental 
  ORG - Universities, institutions and non profits
  COM - Third party, Companies and News organizations

The six character codes are hexadecimal.  The identifiers MUST be case
insensitive.  

Some valid examples for Authority identifiers are given below

  gov-34bb2f
  ORG-221234
  IND-A33FBD

CODE LENGTH CONSIDERATIONS

Four hexadecimal characters allow for 65535 authorities in each category.
A five character hexadecimal code allows for a little more than a million
authorities in each category.  Six HEX characters allows for 16 million. 

6.1.4. Universally Unique Syndicate Identifier


6.1.5. Users

A User MAY be an individual, group or organization that fetches and 
consumes CAP-JSON feeds.  A User SHOULD be able to filter messages from a
feed by a single authority or a set of authorities.  For example, a public
university could set up a server that acts as a syndicate and aggregate the
feeds from several student meteorologists.  A user could then subscribe to 
the university feeds and parse them as she wishes.

Example Scenario:
a. Alice and Bob are student meteorologists at ABC university.
b. ABC University has a meteorology lab running a public "syndicate server."
c. Alice and Bob, as part of their coursework independantly analyze weather
   patterns and publish their data.
d. When they detect signs of rough weather, they publish alerts in JSON-CAP. 
d. Alice and Bob have registered themselves to ABC university syndicate.
e. Each time Alice and Bob publish their CAP-JSON feed, the ABC university 
   syndicate server fetches them and aggregates the feed. 
f. Cathy is a farmer with a CS degree and wishes to be alerted whenever 
   there is a hurricane threat.
g. Cathy subscribes to ABC universitys CAP-JSON feed.  She builds a tool 
   that parses the CAP-JSON feed and alerts him when there is indication of
   a hurricane.
i. Cathy decides that Alice's feeds have better predictions than Bobs.  So
   she filters out and uses just Alice's feeds in her tool. 

Ideally, after Alice publishes her data, it should reach Cathys tool in 
near real time.  Any delay SHOULD only be based on the network bandwidth.


6.1.1 CAP-JSON Identifier

A unique three or four character name specifying the nature of unique string SHOULD
be defined.  This unique string MUST be universally understood as denoting 
a unique identifier for CAP-JSON alert message.  Some codes that were considered
are given below with expansions:

CJM - CAP-JSON Message
EAC - Unique Emergency Code
UAC - Unique Alert Code
AID - Alert IDentifier
AAM - Authorized Alert Message
UEID - Unique Emergency IDentifier
CJID - CAP-JSON IDentifier

6.1.2. Authority Codes


6.1.3. Threat level colour codes

A Threat level color code represents the danger posed by the emergency in
question.  The level of threat is represented by a color.  The color codes
for a given emergency is determined by a combination of factors including
severity of the emergency, certainty of occurance and urgency.  It 
indicates the level of damage to life and property and subtly indicates the
action to be taken as a response. The Threat codes are best left to human
judgement. 

RED --> Significant Threat. Respond by evacuating or seeking shelter.
ORANGE --> Moderate threat. Respond by evacuation or seeking shelter.
YELLOW --> Minimal Threat. Respond by monitoring and staying cautious and
           alert.
GREEN --> No threat. No response needed.
GREY --> Unknown or Uncertain. Respond by monitoring and staying alert.

The color codes can be decided as a function of Severity, Urgency and
Certainty.  We assign a color code to each level in each category.

+--------+----------+-----------+-----------+
|\______ |          |           |           |
| COLOR \| SEVERITY | URGENCY   | CERTAINTY |

6.1.1. Emergency Category

Any emergency MUST be categorized under one or more of the following 
categories.

MET    -- Meteorological, Flood, Rains, Thunderstorms, Hurricanes
GEO    -- Geological: Earthquake, Landslide, Volcanic Eruption, Tsunamis
GEN    -- General safety, Zoo animals escape, etc.
LNO    -- Law and order, Riots, Shooting, Hostage scenarios, kidnap, prison
          break, etc.
MIL    -- War threat, Civil War, Diplomatic emergencies
REC    -- Rescue and Recovery, Trapped Miners
FIRE   -- Forest Fire, etc.
ENV    -- Pollution, Smog, Chemical spill, Oil Spill, Algal Blooms
HEALTH -- Epidemic, Infection outbreaks, Malaria, Flu, etc.
AUTO   -- Automobile accidents, Train accidents, Airplane emergencies
INFRA  -- Road caves in, Bridge breaks, Building Falls
SPACE  -- Meteor Crash, Cosmic Wave Radiation, Solar Flare (CME)
CBRNE  -- Deliberate attacks using Chemical, Biological, Radiological,
          Nuclear agents, EMP attacks
CYBER  -- Internet breaches, Mass Doxxing, identity theft.
MISC   -- Other uncategorized, alien invasions, crop-circles, etc.
 
This property is an array, since a specific event could be categorized as
belonging to more than one category.  A "CYBER" event targeted towards
critical public infrastructure MAY also be an "INFRA" event.  However it is
advisable to categorize events under just one category.

6.1.2. Severity

The Severity denotes the level of threat to life and property.  Also known 
as magnitude or scale of emergency.  

Extreme   -- Extreme threat to life or property
Severe    -- Significant threat to life or property
Moderate  -- Moderate but tangible threat to life or property
Minor     -- Minimal or no threat to life or property
Unknown   -- Unknown.

6.1.2. Magnitude

The magnitude scale is dependant on different events.  The following scales
for magnitude is valid

Earthquakes - Moment Magnitude Scale or Richter Magnitude Scale
Volcanic Eruption - Volcanic Explosivity Index
Space Impact Threat - Palmero Scale or Torino Scale
Hurricane - Saffir-Simpson Wind Scale
Health - Endemic, Epidemic, Pandemic (along with scope)
National Security - NTAS Scale

6.1.3. Certainty
// FIXME: Probabilities ratings for Certainty categories

Certanty is the probability of an event happening.  It SHOULD be a 
reasonably accurate estimate of how likely it is for an event to occur. The
levels of Certainty are given below

Observed - P >= 0.99
Likely   - P >= 0.5
Probable - P <= 0.5
Unlikely - P <~ 0
Unknown

For some events such as earthquakes, Certainty cannot be known.  Therefore
even if Certainty is "Unknown", it is advisable to stay alert and prepared.

6.1.4. Urgency

Urgency defines the duration of time left between present and the start of
occurance of the event.

// FIXME: Better explanations and grammar
Immediate -- The occurance COULD start any moment in the present
Expected  -- The occurance is expected to start in the near future
Past      -- The occurance has already started and ended in the past
Unknown   -- Unknown

For some events such as earthquakes, "Past" urgency is still significant
since there might be aftershocks soon after, depending upon the magnitude
of the event.
